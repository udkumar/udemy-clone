I believe however that technology and its theory are for everyone. So I designed this&nbsp;course to&nbsp;teach each topic in a variety of&nbsp;<strong>easy to digest</strong> ways. Through these multiple reinforcing steps, I believe anyone can follow along and succeed!&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Why is the Theory of Programming Important?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Understanding&nbsp;Computer Science theory is what sets apart&nbsp;<strong>Great programmers&nbsp;</strong>from average ones. Programming theory is something that transcends a single programming language. It gives you skills and techniques you can apply to any programming language you touch. Learning the theory behind programming is just as important, if not more important than learning a singular programming language like Java or C++.</p><p>Programming is all about problem solving. Analyzing a problem, and being able to figure out a way that a computer can help with that problem. Computer Science is the practice of this analysis process. It goes over the techniques and knowledge necessary to design efficient and sustainable code.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you want to begin setting yourself apart from the average programmers, this is the course for you!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Enroll Now and youll Learn:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><ul><li><p>Binary Number System</p></li><li><p>N Notation</p></li><li><p>Big O Notation</p></li><li><p>How to Analyze a Program</p></li><li><p>Arrays and&nbsp;their Advantages</p></li><li><p>Nodes and their Importance</p></li><li><p>Linked&nbsp;Lists and their Advantages and Implementations</p></li><li><p>Stacks implemented with Arrays and Linked&nbsp;Lists</p></li><li><p>Queues Implemented with Arrays and Linked Lists</p></li><li><p>Various Sorting Algorithms and Their Comparisions</p></li><li><p>Trees and Binary Search Trees</p></li><li><p>And Much Much More!&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>My&nbsp;Guarantee</strong></p><p>I am so confident you will enjoy this course, I offer a 100%&nbsp;30-day money-back guarantee through Udemy.&nbsp;If you are not happy with your purchase, I have no problem with giving your money back!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are You Ready to Get Started?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I will be waiting for you inside the course!&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, this is an online course, so you can take it at your own pace.&nbsp;<em>Are you busy right now?&nbsp;</em>Thats okay.

His exercises help you get to the CORE of the issue, which made me feel empowered to become the best version of myself. I also liked that this course included hands-on learning. I felt I was building skills through the process as I did the exercises instead of being given a ton of information and then being expected to magically implement it mid-rage.\nI especially liked that he was not trying to tell me to get rid of anger and that it is a normal human emotion. Understanding it is normal to feel anger and that I have a CHOICE when it comes to expressing it and how I deal with it internally was incredibly beneficial. And I LOVED the mindfulness exercise to rewire my brain!!"})
Review.create!({course_id: c15.id,user_id: u1.id,username: 'Olivia Gardner',rating: 5,body: "This video laid out in-depth, easy to understand concepts that are easy to remember actions for when anger starts to take hold. More importantly, it helps you see how to stop yourself from even getting to that point in the first place. Many of the Udemy courses are unorganized rambling. This seemed professional and organized....Could have used some different backgrounds and supporting graphics, but that's just because I have ADD and I'm a visual learner. I appreciate courses like this because I'm busy and can't always make it to the counselor's office. Looking forward to future content!"})

Every new nutritional supplement or slickly packaged mind-body system preys on the hope and despair of thousands of us who have lived through the repeated failures of stress reduction and weight loss programs. We are constantly bombarded by a social media which insists that WE are the God of our own universe and can change our health and bodies by the sheer power of our mind. Christian Believers reject that idea because we have a radically different worldview. Yet we still struggle with our emotional stress and weight problems, with equally painful defeats. Enroll in this course to learn cutting-edge health science research results and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices, coupled with a clear Scriptural connection to God's Plan for our Peace and Safety.

I've purchased courses on publishing where the instructors are entertainment lawyers and dug deeper than my general knowledge of publishing or a how-to register with the performance rights organization I chose. The information in this course is legit, but mostly unnecessary. The one thing I did appreciate was the bonus lecture of the live call with the copyright.gov agent that discussed changes that are being made to the registration process and what option is ideal for producers registering multiple beats in one registry - which happens to be different from the choice selected in the course."})

Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses.

Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.</p><p>Need to display a list of users in your app?&nbsp;It's as simple as creating a 'User'&nbsp;component and outputting it as often as needed.</p><p>This course will <strong>start at the very basics</strong> and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way <strong>from basic to advanced</strong>. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page)&nbsp;applications!</p><p>A detailed list with the course content can be found below.</p><p><strong>Who's teaching you in this course?</strong></p><p>My name is Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, I'm a freelance web developer and worked with React in many projects. I'm also a 5-star rated instructor here on Udemy. I&nbsp;cover React's most popular alternatives - Vue and Angular - as well as many other topics. I know what I'm talking about and I&nbsp;know where the pain points can be found.</p><p>It's my goal to get you started with React as quick as possible and ensure your success. But I don't just focus on students getting started. I want everyone to benefit from my courses, that's why we'll dive deeply into React and why I&nbsp;made sure to also share knowledge that's helpful to&nbsp;advanced React developers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>This course is for you if ...</p><ul><li><p>...you're just getting started with frontend/&nbsp;JavaScript development and only got the JS&nbsp;basics set (no prior React or other framework experience is required!)</p></li><li><p>...you're experienced with Angular or Vue but want to dive into React</p></li><li><p>...know the React basics but want to refresh them and/ or dive deeper</p></li><li><p>...already worked quite a bit with React but want to dive deeper and see it all come together in a bigger app</p></li></ul><p><strong>What should you bring to succeed in that course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>HTML + CSS&nbsp;+ JavaScript knowledge is required. You don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set</p></li><li><p>NO&nbsp;advanced JavaScript knowledge is required, though you'll be able to move even quicker through the course if you know next-gen JavaScript features like ES6 Arrow functions.<strong> A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course though.</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>What's inside the course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>The 'What', 'Why'&nbsp;and 'How'</p></li><li><p>React Basics (Base features, syntax and concepts)</p></li><li><p>Managing state with class-based components and React Hooks</p></li><li><p>How to output lists and conditional content</p></li><li><p>Styling of React components</p></li><li><p>A deep dive into the internals of React and advanced component features</p></li><li><p>How to access Http content from within React apps (AJAX)</p></li><li><p>Redux,&nbsp;Redux, Redux ... from basics to advanced!</p></li><li><p>Forms and form validation in React apps</p></li><li><p>Authentication</p></li><li><p>An introduction to unit testing</p></li><li><p>An introduction to Next.js</p></li><li><p>React app deployment instructions</p></li><li><p>...and much more!</p></li></ul>",

My goal is to provide you with a <strong>logical strategy</strong> that you can apply to trade the markets with confidence.</p><p>To achieve this goal, we first need to have a look at the <strong>Ichimoku Indicator</strong>. We will start with an introduction in order to familiarize with the complete indicator, then I will dedicate <strong>4</strong> <strong>entire Sections</strong> and <strong>12 entire lectures</strong> to each component of the Ichimoku. <br>You will not find a pre-packed set of rules to apply blindly, you will understand any single component of the Ichimoku, you will learn any single formula and the reasons why we trade it in a certain way. This allows you to understand <strong>when and how to use the Ichimoku Indicator</strong>, being able to differentiate between different market scenarios, finding the best opportunities to trade and make money trading the Forex Market.</p><p>Section 8 is entirely dedicated to <strong>Forex Market analysis</strong> using the whole indicator, so you can start to familiarize with all the techniques and methods that we have studied in the previous sections.</p><p>After that, we will have another important part of the strategy: <strong>Risk Management</strong>.</p><p>If you had the chance to enroll in one of my other courses, you know that I like to keep things real. A strategy that helps only to analyze the market, without having a deep focus on <strong>Stop Loss</strong> and <strong>Take Profit</strong>, is not a complete strategy for me. So, my promise is to give you a complete strategy with a whole Section about Entry and Exit points, in order to understand how to open and manage your trades.</p><p>As usual, when I publish a new course, I also open a new <strong>Live Forex Trading Account with real money</strong> to publish live trades in the course and update the results with the strategy.

  description: "<p>This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning&nbsp;series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in <strong>Theano</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and you know how to run code using the GPU.</p><p>This course is all about how to use deep learning for&nbsp;<strong>computer vision</strong> using&nbsp;<strong>convolutional neural networks</strong>. These are the state of the art when it comes to&nbsp;<strong>image classification</strong> and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST.</p><p>In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the&nbsp;<strong>StreetView House Number (SVHN)&nbsp;</strong>dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles&nbsp;- so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge!</p><p>Because&nbsp;<strong>convolution</strong> is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as&nbsp;<strong>modeling artificial organs</strong> like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to&nbsp;<strong>audio</strong>, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for&nbsp;<strong>image effects,&nbsp;</strong>like the&nbsp;<strong>Gaussian blur&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>edge detection</strong>.</p><p>We will also do some&nbsp;<strong>biology</strong> and talk about how convolutional neural networks have been inspired by the&nbsp;<strong>animal visual cortex</strong>.</p><p>After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time (in part 2)&nbsp;with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset.</p><p>All the materials for this course are FREE. You can download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Theano, and TensorFlow with simple commands shown in previous courses.</p><p>This course focuses on '<strong>how to build and understand</strong>', not just 'how to use'. Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about 'remembering facts', it's about&nbsp;<strong>'seeing for yourself' via experimentation</strong>. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally. If you want&nbsp;<strong>more</strong>&nbsp;than just a superficial look at machine learning models, this course is for you.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Suggested Prerequisites:</p><ul><li><p>matrix addition and multiplication</p></li><li><p>Python coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets</p></li><li><p>Numpy coding: matrix and vector operations, loading a CSV file</p></li><li><p>Know the basic theory behind feedforward neural networks</p></li><li><p>Can write a feedforward neural network in Theano or TensorFlow</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>TIPS (for getting through the course):</p><ul><li><p>Watch it at 2x.</p></li><li><p>Take handwritten notes. This will drastically increase your ability to retain the information.</p></li><li><p>Write down the equations. If you don't, I guarantee it will just look like gibberish.</p></li><li><p>Ask lots of questions on the discussion board. The more the better!</p></li><li><p>Realize that most exercises will take you days or weeks to complete.</p></li><li><p>Write code yourself, don't just sit there and look at my code.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>WHAT&nbsp;ORDER&nbsp;SHOULD&nbsp;I&nbsp;TAKE&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;COURSES&nbsp;IN?:</p><ul><li><p>Check out the lecture 'What order should I take your courses in?' (available in the Appendix of any of my courses, including the free Numpy course)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

But for the merge sort time complexity will be Œü(n log n). It‚Äôs somewhat less complexity than other sorting algorithm. I hope you remember that, Divide and conquer means dived the bigger problems to small problems and conquer means analyze the problem and finally combine the results.Merge Sort",

  title: "Data Structures and Algorithms : In this video we are going to discuss about quick sorting algorithm. This algorithm applies divide and conquer approach to solve the sorting problem. As we have already discussed, Divide and conquer means dive the bigger problems to small problems and conquer means analyze the problem and finally combine the result. The overall idea of the quick search algorithm is, choosing one element as a pivot element and partitioning the array around it. means the element which is smaller than pivot, has to be moved to left hand side of the pivot and the element which is greater the pivot, has to be moved to right hand side of the pivot.

In this Unit we have seen lots of algorithm for sorting the elements in the collection. Compared with all other algorithm, heap sort algorithm will be more efficient than other algorithms. Why because, if you take Merge sort its time complexity will be nLogn but While we think about space its taking more space to execute the algorithm right I hope you remember that its O(n). Lets think about Quick sort its space complexity will be O(1) but what about its time complexity  in worst case. Its O(n2).But if we use heap sort to sort the element in an array time complexity will be O(nLogn) and space complexity will be O(1). Its better deal right.Heap Sort",

Resilient minds can adjust expectations on the fly. Flexible expectations act like a car's suspension adapting to variations in the road of life - cheesy but true! Ridged minds buckle and break! To keep your mind supple practice these two things: Banish 'should' and 'must' from your internal and external vocabulary. (I'm not kidding Marshall Rosenberg calls says that should is the most violent word that we use on ourselves and others!) Ask yourself,\"Are my expectations realistic?\" when you find yourself disappointed.

  title: "One of the problems that people face in writing algorithms is how to translate their thoughts into a programming language. Many people cannot even start writing the very first statement of an algorithm. I suggest that if you are having such trouble, don't try to solve the whole problem together, rather break it down into smaller, easier parts. For e.g. try doing the following in writing code for the selection sort algorithm -\n\n\tFirst try to write a method, which just finds the minimum number in the data array. Don't think about anything else, just that method.  If you write it in a different method, then you may need to pass the data array as a parameter to that method. Return the index of that minimum element from this method.\n\t Now change the method to find the minimum number STARTING FROM A PARTICULAR INDEX. So you will need to pass this index as a parameter.\n\t  Write another method which can swap items in an array, located at two different indexes. What parameters should be passed to this method?  \n\n\t Hopefully, by this time you will have enough clarity on completing the sorting algorithm, if you understood the pseudo code.\nSelection Sort : Pseudocode",
